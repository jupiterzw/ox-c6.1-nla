# C6.1 Numerical Linear Algebra 2024/25
Lecturer: [Yuji Nakatsukasa](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nakatsukasa/)

This repo contains my notes for the Oxford Mathematics Institute Part C course C6.1: Numerical Linear Algebra. The course covers:

- Common problems in linear algebra
- Matrix structure and the singular value decomposition (SVD)
- QR factorization and the QR algorithm for computing eigenvalues
- Direct solution methods for linear systems, including Gaussian elimination and its variants
- Iterative solution methods for linear systems
- Chebyshev polynomials, conjugate gradient methods, convergence analysis, and preconditioning
- Randomized algorithms for least-squares problems and low-rank matrix approximation.
